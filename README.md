# Fraud Transaction Detection System

## Problem Statement

With the rapid growth of digital payments and online banking, the risk of financial fraud has also increased. Traditional rule-based systems often fall short in identifying complex fraud patterns, especially when processing millions of transactions in real-time.
This project aims to build an intelligent, data-driven solution that detects fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. It focuses on achieving high accuracy, precision, and recall while handling a large-scale dataset.

## Project Overview

The Fraud Transaction Detection System is designed to analyze a large dataset of transaction records and accurately identify potentially fraudulent activity. The dataset contains 6,362,620 records and 10 columns, including features that describe transaction behavior and a target variable indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent.
The system applies a series of data science steps, including data preprocessing, exploration, model training, and evaluation. It uses advanced machine learning models to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions effectively.

## System Objectives

- To process large-scale transactional data efficiently.
- To develop a supervised learning model that accurately detects fraud.
- To handle class imbalance using techniques such as resampling or class weighting.
- To provide insights into model performance through evaluation metrics and visualization.

## Key Features

- Large dataset handling (6.3 million+ records)
- Fraud detection using binary classification
- Imbalanced data handling (e.g., SMOTE, undersampling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature engineering
- Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost
- Evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- XGBoost (optional) for gradient boosting
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive development

## Dataset Information

- Rows: 6,362,620
- Columns: 10
- Target Variable: is_fraud (1 = Fraud, 0 = Not Fraud)

The dataset contains anonymized and pre-processed transaction details suitable for binary classification tasks.

## Workflow

1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering and Selection
5. Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets
6. Model Training and Tuning
7. Model Evaluation and Visualization
8. Exporting Results and Model (Optional)

##Usage
Load the dataset in the notebook.
Run each cell to process data, build models, and evaluate results.
Explore the results using visual tools like confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.
Customize and extend the model for future use.
